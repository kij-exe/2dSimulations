# 2dSimulations
Y13 project | 2d Mechanics Simulations

Particle Projection Simulation as a web application. Can be accessed by the link https://kij-exe.github.io/2dSimulations/. Controls are explained on the website.
The project was intended for students first learning basics of particle projection physics. It allows you to interactively launch particles with different velocities and observe their trajectories. You can change the scale and camera view on the canvas to achieve a setup you want.

The event system allows to set up stopping points for simulation to track specific conditions. In this way you can stop simulation when a particle reaches specific speed or position by x or y axis. For example, you can get position of a particle when it is at its highest point on trajectory. All you need to do is set up an event for when the particle reaches the speed of 0 by y axis and observe position of a particle on the window on the right when simulation stops.
